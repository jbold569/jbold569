title: Agent Based Logging
description: Whether you're working in site reliability, business intelligence, or security, one thing rings true. Logs are king. They are a window into your operations, providing insights into access, change, performance, who, what, when, where, and why. However, just as logs can be invaluable they can just as easily be burdensome and costly. Poor log hygiene plagues many organizations. While many business functions benefit from logs, they don't benefit from all logs and the excess translates directly to cost. In this post we'll explore some options for logging instrumentation that aid in filtering, routing, and maintaining the flow of logs at the host level.
