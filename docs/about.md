To the point, I love problem solving. I was the kid that was captivated by the wooden lock puzzles at the local book stores. When my parents wouldn't buy me the latest [K'Nex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K'Nex) set, I all pictures available to me as I attempted to recreate the models with my existing pieces. My passion for creation led me to software and engineering, and continues to fuel my appetite for complex problems.

My current path has me leading efforts in defensive/proactive cybersecurity. I got here by riding the "Big Data" wave. I've weathered many initiatives designing, building, and managing systems that transport and analyze data at scale. It's my core belief that technology alone can't address the challenges I've encountered, and that time should be taken to invest in those that stand beside you through the endeavor.

I've grown to hold many titles. Business owner, leader, architect, friend, husband, handy man, man of many hobbies, and occasionally "pain in the butt" (thanks mom). If you've found this site, hopefully you'll learn a little bit about me but more importantly I want you to take my learned experiences back to grow your organizations, your teams, and yourself.

*"Humility is the true key to success. Successful people lose their way at times. They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits of success. Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap. Humble people share the credit and wealth, remaining focused and hungry to continue the journey of success."* - Rick Pitino
